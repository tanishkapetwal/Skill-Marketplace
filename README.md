spring initializer:-

spring web,
spring data jpa,
postgreSql driver,
spring boot devtools,
lombok,
spring security


manual:-

spring boot actuator,
spring boot starter validation,
modelMapper,
jjwt,
spring security config,
spring boot starter websocket,
spring boot starter mail




So every manually added dependency should have no specific version mentioned in code except the library dependencies like jjwt and model mapper
